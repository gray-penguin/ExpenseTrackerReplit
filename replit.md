# Expense Tracker - Migrated to Replit

## Project Overview
A multi-user expense tracking application that allows users to log, categorize, and analyze their spending. Originally built in Bolt, now successfully migrated to Replit's full-stack JavaScript template.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Express.js server with RESTful API endpoints
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using wouter for routing
- **Database**: Browser state management using localStorage with sophisticated data hooks
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for API state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

## Current Features

### Core Functionality
✅ **User Management**: Multiple users with profiles, avatars, and default preferences
✅ **Expense Tracking**: Add, edit, delete expenses with detailed information
✅ **Category System**: Hierarchical categorization with subcategories
✅ **Dashboard**: Comprehensive overview with statistics and spending analysis
✅ **Data Filtering**: Filter expenses by user, date range, and categories

### Key Components
- **Dashboard**: Real-time statistics, spending trends, category breakdowns
- **Expenses List**: Full expense management with CRUD operations
